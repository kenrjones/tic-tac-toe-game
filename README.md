# tic-tac-toe  

## Big Goals:  
• Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase<br>
• Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the application<br>
• Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete<br>

## User Stories:  

### Epics
• I am a user that only has time for games during brief moments during my busy schedulae<br> (lunch breaks, public transit, between meetings, bathroom, before bed)<br>
• As user, I enjoy classic games with simple instructions<br>
• As a user, like challenging myself with individual games then challenging other users to test my skills<br>
• I am a user that is attracted to clean design and web-pages/apps that are easy to navigate<br> 

### Direct User Stores for Tic Tac Toe
• As a user, I should be able to easily start the game<br>  
• As a user, I should be able to alternate between the game pieces (X, O) with AI or other users<br> 
• As a user, I should be shown a message displaying who's turn it is<br> 
• As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or end the game with a draw<br>
• As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or draw<br> 

## Aproach:
KISS = 'Keep It Simple Stupid'<br> 

My goal was to build a simple yet dynamic game of Tic Tac Toe that involved minimal html and css along with a esay to navagate js logic that consited of using flexbox and css grid layouts, looping through arrarys, calling functions, and using event listners. My aim was not to re-envent the wheel. I just wanted to give a nice refresh to a classic game.<br>
